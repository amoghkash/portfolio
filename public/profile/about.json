    "about": "Hi, I’m Amogh, a tech enthusiast with a knack for turning wild ideas into reality. Whether it's crafting a wearable device to detect concussions in real time or designing avionics for amphibious drones, I thrive at the intersection of creativity and engineering. As a Georgia Tech student and aspiring innovator, I’ve dived into everything from firmware development for medical devices to helping rockets reach for the stars (literally).\n\nBut **there’s more to me than just circuit boards and code.** My friends would probably describe me as the guy who’s up for a 4 a.m. heart-to-heart after a long day at the beach, or the one who brings infectious energy to every activity and conversation. I'm the kind of person who might overthink what to order at a restaurant, but when it comes to my work, I dive right in and figure things out as I go.\n\nWhen I’m not in the lab or tinkering with prototypes, you can find me at the gym, exploring new places, or just spending time with my family and friends. Let’s connect—whether you’re here to talk tech, share ideas, or just say hi!",
