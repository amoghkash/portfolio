    "about": "Hi my name's Amogh!\n\nI'm a motivated Computer Engineering student at Georgia Tech \n with an interest in embedded systems, applied AI/ML, and hardware + software development. I am pursuing a concentration in Information and Signal Processing & Computing Hardware & Emerging Architectures.\n\nI love to tinker with electronics and work on personal projects in my free time, as well go to the gym and also explore new places to eat (as contradictory as that may sound).",
